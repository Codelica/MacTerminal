Fully packaged\r\n2. Currently with option to open new tab on OS X (works fine on 10.8)\r\n3. Sublime Text 3 beta support\r\n\r\n# How to install ?\r\n### From git:\r\n```\r\ncd $PATH_OF_SUBLIME_PACKAGES\r\ngit clone git://github.com/afterdesign/MacTerminal.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### From [package control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)\r\nJust type MacTerminal\r\n\r\n# FAQ\r\n1. How do I use this ?\r\n\r\n    Just use \"ctrl+command+t\" while editing file to open terminal with cd to directory where the file exists.\r\n\r\n    You can also use the \"Open in terminal\" option in sidebar.\r\n\r\n2. How can I change shortcut ?\r\n\r\n    Go to:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences     -> Package Settings -> Macterminal -> Key Bindings - User\r\n    ```\r\n    and add something like:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    { \"keys\": [\"super+t\"], \"command\": \"open_mac_terminal\" }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n3. The \"Open in terminal\" is greyed out.\r\n    This happens when there is no opened file and for now I don't know if\r\n    this is just a sublime bug or I need to change something.\r\n        For now I saw the same behavior in\r\n\r\n4. How to I use it with iTerm 2 ?\r\n    Simply go to:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> Macterminal -> Settings - User\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    and add:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n        \"terminal\"   :  \"iterm\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    If you wish you can also change it in Settings - Default.\r\n\r\n5. How do I change path to ``` osascript ``` ?\r\n\r\n    To check what is path for ``` osascript ``` just open terminal and type:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    which osascript\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    With path simply go to:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> Macterminal -> Settings - User\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    and add:\r\n\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n        \"osascript\"   :  \"/usr/bin/osascript\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n6. Can I always open main directory of project ?\r\n\r\n    From version 2.0 you can.\r\n\r\n    Open:\r\n    ```\r\n    Sublime Text 2 -> Preferences -> Package Settings -> Macterminal -> Settings - User\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    And set :\r\n    ```\r\n    {\r\n        \"directory_mode\" : \"project\"\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n    From now on if you have only 1 directory added to project it's going to be opened by default.\r\n    If you have more than 1 directory in your project you'll see quickpanel to select what you would like to open.\r\n\r\n    ![](https://raw.github.com/afterdesign/MacTerminal/master/messages/macterminal_2.gif)\r\n\r\n    Thanks [@dirajkumar](https://github.com/dirajkumar) for the idea !\r\n\r\n7. Its not working for me.\r\n\r\n    First of all enable ```debug``` mode. To do this open your settings and add:\r\n    ``` \"debug\": true ```\r\n\r\n    After this try to open terminal again. If it's not working (and debug shouldn't repair the problem)\r\n    open sublime console (default shortcut is ``` ctrl+` ```) and open new issue with log\r\n    between ```---MacTerminal Debug Start---``` and ```---MacTerminal Debug End---```.\r\n\r\n    You can always ping me on [twitter](http://twitter.com/afterdeign) or\r\n    simply write [issue on github](https://github.com/afterdesign/MacTerminal/issues).\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n\r\nYou can follow me on twitter: [@afterdesign](http://twitter.com/afterdesign)\r\nor find me on coderwall: [@afterdesign](http://coderwall.com/afterdesign)\r\nor find me on g+: [+RafałMalinowski](https://plus.google.com/+RafałMalinowski)\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nLicensed under the [MIT license](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
